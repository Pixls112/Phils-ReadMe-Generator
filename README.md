 ## Description
 For week 9, my project was to create a simple README.md file generator using node.js and Inquirer package. As someone who tends to overlook things and forget, the problem I run into most is that I usually forget  to write my README.md after I finish coding, but that is also due to my laziness. However this project has fixed that. This application is designed to prompt the user with some questions and taking the input from the user and slapping it right into a outline of a README.md and then BLAM your README.md file which you were to lazy to do is now done.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself.

 ## Usage
 As stated in the description the main usage of this project is to provide the user a quick and easy way to create a README.md for there project/application.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I would like to give credit to Matthew K. a classmate of mine who helped me with the generateMarkdown as I could not figure out why the badge wouldn't display.
